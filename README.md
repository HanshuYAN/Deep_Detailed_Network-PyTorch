# Deep_Detailed_Network-PyTorch
This is A PyTorch Reproduction of the "Deep Detailed Network" model, CVPR2017-https://xueyangfu.github.io/projects/cvpr2017.html (DDN), for the Rain Streak Removal task.

The DDN model is trained and evaluated on the Rain100L and Rain100L datasets. These two sets can be found at http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html. The pre-trained models are provided in this repository.

Testing Results (PSNR) :
 - The Rain100L testset: 33.582 dB;
 - The Rain100H testset: 23.905 dB.
